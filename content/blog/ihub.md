Had quite a few people wonder how to gain access to the [iHub at UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/for-students/current-students/managing-your-course/current-students-information-engineering-and-information-technology/innovation-hub) but the information on that page seems quite out of date so heres a little guide if it helps~ 

1. First, head over to https://login.uts.edu.au and login with your student or staff account
2. In the list of apps, find and click on "Rapid Global" - this is the platform they use for all their training modules
3. Click "Trainee Portal"
4. Click "Courses" at the top
5. The course "Safety and Wellbeing Essentials" should be listed under *courses requiring action* but if it isn't, try pressing the "Add Course" button and search for it
6. Complete the course and quiz
7. Once done, your card should automatically be enabled for the room, however it may take a few days to activate!

Hope that helps :3
