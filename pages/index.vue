"Initially, This project was a part of Game Design Studio 1 at UTS where we worked in teams of 5 people to create a game through the semester. 

During the assignment, my main contributions were general programming and game logic as well as some of the back-end code for the local and online multiplayer systems and UI.

After the completion of the subject, our group continued to work on the project in our own time to further improve it and showcase it at future events such as the UTS Tech Fest where we received the Best Student Game award, and also South By South West where we were nominated for Best Student Game.

In these later stages of development my focus shifted more to project management in addition building the Steam page and finalizing the integration of services such as achievements, cloud saves and discord rich presence into the game.

On the 19th of February the game was released and since then we have had over 4200 unique players!"

"Temple of the Silver Dragon is one of my older projects which was made in the Unity game engine before I switched over to Godot.

It's one of my most extensive works as it entirely a solo project, In addition to the main game play components such as: First person camera and movement, level design, enemy logic, game logic, testing and balancing. I also implemented some special features including a 'Ghost' replay system and an online leaderboard using Airtable. Through this leaderboard I've been able to calculate that a total of over 110 hours have been played!"
